# super_pentagon (wip)

Stochastic generation of [pentagonal tiling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pentagonal_tiling).

Trying out few algorithms and tools to generate this kind of tilings. I would like to play with:
  - WebGL
  - Erlang
  - Rust
  - genetic algorithms
  - artificial neural networks
